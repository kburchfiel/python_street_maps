## Charlottesville Street Map Creator

By Kenneth Burchfiel

*(More documentation to come!)*

This Python script shows how to use the Plotly and fpdf libraries to (1) create a series of Charlottesville maps, then (2) save these maps to a PDF file. You are welcome to adapt the script to create maps of other cities.

Although the Python *code* is released under the MIT license, the maps themselves contain OpenStreetMap data and are thus available under the Open Database License. See openstreetmap.org/copyright for more details.
